      Demystifying AI: How the AI Education Project is Advocating for AI Literacy
    </h2>

    <p class= "writing">
    As AI revolutionizes how we live, understanding its complex nature has never been more important. AI literacy allows individuals to not only understand technology, but also participate in its development. 
    </p>
    <p class= "writing">
    In this blog post, we discuss the transformative potential of knowledge as the AI Education Project works to spread awareness on AI to all individuals.

      What is the AI Education Project?
    </h5>

    <h6>
      How it Started 
    </h6>

    <p class="writing">
      aiEDU is an educational project focused on increasing AI literacy among students and educators. In 2019, a meeting in a community with limited access to AI and automation revealed that AI education was low among the student population. This encounter led to the AI Education Project (AIEDU), a groundbreaking initiative aimed at bridging the knowledge gap by diversifying AI literacy.
    </p>
      <p class="writing">
      Alongside the Georgetown Center for Security & Emerging Technology (CSET), the founding members of aiEDU conducted an extensive analysis to determine if the lack of AI education was a widespread issue. They discovered that a significant majority of students in the United States complete their education without any exposure to artificial intelligence, despite the rising traction surrounding AI advancement. 
    </p>
      <p class="writing">
      Recognizing the importance of AI literacy and the digital divide, the founding team of aiEDU wanted to understand the extent of this issue and spread knowledge on the advancement of technology.
